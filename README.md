# My First Flutter App

This is my first Flutter app, where I'm creating a shopping mall to be released in April.

## Overview

I'm excited to share my journey of learning Flutter by developing this shopping mall application. This project aims to provide a seamless shopping experience for users, with a focus on user-friendly interface design and efficient functionality.

## Features

- **Product Catalog**: Browse through a wide range of products available in the shopping mall.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration system for users to manage their accounts.
- **Shopping Cart**: Add products to a cart and proceed to checkout for a seamless shopping experience.
- **Order Management**: Track and manage orders for both users and administrators.
- **Payment Integration**: Integration with popular payment gateways for secure and convenient transactions.

## Release Schedule

I plan to release the shopping mall application in April, with regular updates and improvements to enhance the user experience.
